                <p class="f-p">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br> were current, if not
                    more so,
                    in the company I joined. I <br> honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
                <p class="sec-p">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                    <br>
                    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
                    for <br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                    The next 12 <br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                    the course, I’ve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                <p class="sec-small-p">“ I started as a total newbie with <br> virtually no coding skills. I now work
                    <br> as a mobile engineer
                    for a big <br> company. This was one of the best <br> investments I’ve made in myself. ”

                    from them and
                    learning from <br> their experiences was easy.</p>
                <p class="sec-p"> “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing.
                    The <br> program
                    gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br> myself as a
                    capable
                    junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the <br> personal attention you need

                    an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

                <p class="p-5">Such a life-changing <br> experience. Highly <br> recommended!</p>
                <p class="sec-p-5">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br>
                    some structure from
                    professionals <br> who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br>
                    enroll by a former
                    student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br>
                    curriculum and
                    staff
                    did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br> and I never had to wait long for <br>
                    assistance. The agile
                    team
                    project, in <br> particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way
                    <br> that no
                    tutorial
                    could ever have. In <br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my
                    <br> developent
                    experience. It certainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving
                    multiple <br>
                    offers.
                    100% recommend! ”
